# Inheritance

Single class inheritance is supported using 'Implements Via'

`Implements Host via Collection = New Collection`

The variable `Host` exposes all public methods of the `Collection` class

Collection class methods may be overridden by defining a class method with the same name as a method from the Collection class.

Overridden mathods may be called by qualifying the method name e.g. `Host.Add`
